# trash-collector-pro

A simple python script to remove files older than `x` number of days (30 by default) from your downloads folder.

## Usage

Clone the repo, or just grab `clean_up.py` and run it in a command line. Oh, and save it somewhere other than your downloads folder in order to avoid a cannibalistic disaster of irreparable scale.

## Caveats
 - macOS friendly, for now
 - `crontab` not included. As is, must be run manually.
