# trash-collector-pro

A simple python script to remove files older than x number of days (30 by default) from your downloads folder.

## Usage

Clone the repo, or just grab the `clean_up.py` script and run it in terminal. Oh, and put it somewhere other than your downloads folder in order to avoid a cannibalistic disaster of irreparable scale.

## Roadmap
 - Cron to schedule a regular cleaning
 - Prompt for confirmation prior to cleaning
